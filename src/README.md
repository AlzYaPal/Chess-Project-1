#How to use my Chess Engine

###Instructions:

After downloading the code, run chess_main.py to load the chess engine.  Make sure all the assets are downloaded, their names are the same as in this repository and the file structure is the same as in this repository.

To play the game, click the piece you want to move (you can't select a piece if it isn't their turn - i.e. If it's black to move, the white Queen can't be selected) and select where to move it to from the highlighted squares

Have fun
